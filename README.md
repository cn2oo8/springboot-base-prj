# MoliCode index page

## Introduce

MoliCode is a code generator for java and other language. It's a standalone tool to generate code and store code template in maven repository . So I want to make a good tool for everybody to share their code template and generate code easier. that's it.

## Disclaimer
This project is depends on JXBrowser's Open-Source Licence. The JXBrowser product is a proprietary software owned by temdev company, It can't be used for comercial business. 
And the JXBrowser is based on chromium embeded . It's easy to embeded chromium into java application just need few line codes.

## The name 
Because I like jasmine flower , and I have planted many jasmine flower On my Balcony . So I named it moli, that's the Chinese pronunciation of jasmine flower. meanwhile the 'moli' has the meaning of magic in chinese, So I hope this auto code generator will have the magic power to help every one save time of dumping code.
                                                                                                       
 Moli is white and with delicate fragrance and have magic power to make your life joyful.
